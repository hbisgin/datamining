Well, a cursor that you really cannot see, but still a cursor. This invisible cursor tells the read function (and many other I/O functions) where to start from. To set where the cursor is, you use the `seek()` function. It is used in the form `seek(offset, whence)`.\n",

        "\n",
        "`tell()` returns where the cursor is in the file. It has no parameters, just type it in (like what the example below will show). This is infinitely useful, for knowing what you are referring to, where it is, and simple control of the cursor. To use it, type `fileobjectname.tell()` - where fileobjectname is the name of the file object you created when you opened the file (in `openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')` the file object name is `openfile`).\n",
        "\n",
        "`readline()` reads from where the cursor is till the end of the line. Remember that the end of the line isn't the edge of your screen - the line ends when you press enter to create a new line. This is useful for things like reading a log of events, or going through something progressively to process it. There are no parameters you have to pass to `readline()`, though you can optionally tell it the maximum number of bytes/letters to read by putting a number in the brackets. Use it with `fileobjectname.readline()`.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "`readlines()` is much like `readline()`, however `readlines()` reads all the lines from the cursor onwards, and returns a list, with each list element holding a line of code. Use it with `fileobjectname.readlines()`. For example, if you had the text file:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Line 1\n",

        "| 4 | \" |\n",
        "| 5 | 'Line 6' |\n",
        "\n",
        "The `write()` function, writes to the file. How did you guess??? It writes from where the cursor is, and overwrites text in front of it - like in MS Word, where you press 'insert' and it writes over the top of old text. To utilise this most purposeful function, put a string between the brackets to write e.g. `fileobjectname.write('this is a string')`.\n",
        "\n",
        "`close`, you may figure, closes the file so that you can no longer read or write to it until you reopen in again. Simple enough. To use, you would write `fileobjectname.close()`. Simple!\n",
