Welcome to our [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for our Facebook Live session on Introduction to the Tidyverse. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

You can execute chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows. 

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses, such as [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for data visualization and [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for data wrangling. You'll focus on these two in this session.

FYI, A package is essentially a set of tools for doing stuff with data. 

For more on the Tidyverse, check out David Robinson's [Introduction to Tidyverse course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) on DataCamp and the [Learn the Tidyverse resources](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/).

Install the tidyverse, if you haven't already:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Install the tidyverse
# install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Now that you've installed the tidyverse, it's time to load your data and check out some of the observations.

In this code along session, you'll be exploring the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), where each observation is a person and each variable is a feature such as "Name", "Age" and "Survived" (or not).

Load your data:

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Import the Tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
passengers <- read.csv("data/train.csv")


# Check out the first several observations of your dataframe
passengers
```

What are all of these variables? See [dataset description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) for more details.

To get an overview of your data, use the function "summary":


```{r message = FALSE}
# Summarize titanic
summary(passengers)
```

Now do the same using a pipe, one of the handiest tools in the tidyverse:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Summarize titanic using a pipe
passengers %>%
  summary()

```

Do the same after dropping observations that have missing values (hint: you can concatenate pipes):

```{r message = FALSE}
# Summarize titanic after dropping na
passengers %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summary()
```

You may have noticed stylistic consistency in the code that we've written above. That's because we're adhering to a style guide. In data science *and* programming/coding in general, it's important to get accustomed to using a style guide asap. As Hadley Wickham puts it in the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html),

> Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.

**Recap:**

* You've imported your data & checked it out
* You've learnt about the pipe operator `%>%`

**Up next:**

* Data wrangling with `dplyr` to **filter** your data, **arrange** it and create new features by **mutating** old ones.

## Wrangle your data

Now it's time to explore your data and get some initial insight into the dataset. You'll be using `dplyr` **verbs** such as `filter`, `arrange` and `mutate`, which do exactly what they say. 

Let's sat that we wanted to choose a particular set of observations, say, those for which the "Sex" was 'female'. `dplyr` allows us to do intuitively and in a language that mirrors how we think and talk about data.

The `filter` verb chooses only the observations that match the condition. See it in action:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Filter to get all "male" rows
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "male")
```

**What can you see here?** Any ideas about whether men are likely to have survived or not?

**Note**: 

* you can read `dplyr` code like a sentence: take your data and then (`%>%`) filter it according the condition that the sex is male.
* the above does **not** alter the original dataframe.
* `filter(Sex = "male")` is a common error (I've made it); there's a cool [tidyverse error guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/error-messages.html).

```{r message = FALSE}
# Filter to get all "female" rows
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "female")
```

**What can you see here?** Any ideas about whether women are likely to have survived or not?

Lets say you wanted to `arrange` your observations by increaing Fare to see if you can notice any trends. You can use the **verb** `arrange` to achieve this:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Arrange by increasing Fare
passengers %>% 
  arrange(Fare)
```

**What can you see here?** 

You can also `arrange` by decreasing Fare:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Arrange by decreasing Fare
passengers %>% 
  arrange(desc(Fare))
```

**What can you see here?** 

Sometimes you may wish to create new variables. We know that the variable "Parch" is the number of parents and children while "SibSp" is the number of siblings and spouses. We can add these together to get a new variable "FamSize". To do so, you `mutate` the original variables into the new one.

```{r message = FALSE}
# Create new column FamSize (size of family)
passengers %>% 
  mutate(FamSize = Parch + SibSp)
```

**Note:**

* `mutate()` can be used to create new columns but also modify existing columns in much the same way that a mutation may from a biological perspective. It's not exactly right but a nice way to provide context for verb choice.

Is it possible that largeer family have a lower rate of survival?

To test this hypothesis, create a new variable "FamSize" as the sum of "Parch" and "SibSp" as above, then arrange by decreasing "FamSize":

```{r message = FALSE}
# Create new column FamSize (size of family)
# Arrange by decreasing FamSize
passengers %>% 
  mutate(FamSize = Parch + SibSp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(FamSize))
```

As zeroes and ones don't often say a great deal, mutate the values of the "Survived" variable to strings "No" and "Yes" (and create new dataframe!):

```{r message = FALSE}
# Turn numerical values of Survived column to "No" & "Yes" (new dataframe)
passengers1 <- passengers %>% 
  mutate(Survived = ifelse(Survived == 0, "No", "Yes"))
passengers1
```

**Recap:**

* You've imported your data & checked it out
* You've learnt about the pipe operator `%>%`
* You can now use `dplyr` to wrangle your data: `filter` it, `arrange` it and create new features by `mutating` old ones.

All of this and more is covered in Chapter 1 of David Robinson's [Introduction to Tidyverse course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) on DataCamp.

**Up next:**

* You'll learn how to easily and intuitively plot your data using `ggplot2`.

## Plotting your data

To plot your data using `ggplot2`, you specify three things:

* Your data
* Your aesthetics (e.g. what's on the x-axis)
* Your layers (e.g. barplot, scatterplot)


First you'll plot a barplot of Sex to see how many males and females were recorded aboard the Titanic:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Plot barplot of passenger Sex
ggplot(passengers, aes(x = Sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**What can you see here?** 

**Note:**

*  the `aes()` function is really a way to map the `aes`thetics of the plot to the variables in the data. See [Modern Dive](http://moderndive.com/3-viz.html#grammarofgraphics) by Chester Ismay & Albert Y. Kim for more.

Now it's time for some scatter plots. Is the Age of any given passenger correlated with the Fare that they paid?

```{r message = FALSE}
# Scatter plot of Age vs Fare
ggplot(passengers, aes(x = Age, y = Fare)) +
  geom_point()
```

**What can you see here?** 

**Note:**

* You can read your `ggplot2` code like a sentence, just like your `dplyr` code above: "We take the data as titanic and we map Age to the x axis and Fare to the y axis, adding points on as the layer of the plot."


Let's take the previous plot and color each point by Sex, to see any correlations between Sex, Age and Fare:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Scatter plot of Age vs Fare colored by Sex
ggplot(passengers %>% drop_na(), aes(x = Age, y = Fare, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point()
```

**What can you see here?** 

Visualizing three variables on one plot is pretty cool, but what if wanted to throw the Survived variable into the mix to see if there are any apparent trends?

Faceting is a way to produce multiple plots simultaneously:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Scatter plot of Age vs Fare colored by Sex faceted by Survived
ggplot(passengers1, aes(x = Age, y = Fare, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~Survived)
```

**What can you see here?** 

Now let's redo our bar plot of passenger "Sex" and this time fill our bars according to "Survived":

```{r message = FALSE}
# Plot barplot of passenger Sex & fill according to Survival
ggplot(passengers1, aes(x = Sex, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**What can you see here?** 


**Recap:**

* You've imported your data & checked it out
* You've learnt about the pipe operator `%>%`
* You can now use `dplyr` to wrangle your data: `filter` it, `arrange` it and create new features by `mutating` old ones.
* You've learnt how to easily and intuitively plot your data using `ggplot2`.

All of this and more is covered in Chapters 1 & 2 of David Robinson's [Introduction to Tidyverse course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) on DataCamp.

**Up next:**

* Learn how to summarise your data across many dimensions, such as "Sex".

## Summarizing and grouping your data

Use the `summarise` verb to find out the mean fare paid:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare
passengers %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare))
```

Use the `summarise` verb to find out the median fare paid:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare
passengers %>% 
  summarise(medianFare = median(Fare))
```

Use the `filter` and `summarise` verbs to find out the mean fare paid among men:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare for men
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "male") %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare))

```

Use the `filter` and `summarise` verbs to find out the mean fare paid among women:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare for women
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "female") %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare))
```

Use the `filter` and `summarise` verbs to find out the mean fare paid among women **and** how many women survived:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare & number of survivors for women
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "female") %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare), numSurv = sum(Survived))
```

Use the `group_by` and `summarise` verbs to find the mean fare and number of survivors as a function of sex:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare & number of survivors grouped by Sex
passengers %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare), numSurv = sum(Survived))
```

Use the `group_by` and `summarise` verbs to find the mean fare and proportion of survivors as a function of sex:


```{r message = FALSE}
# Check out mean Fare & proportion of survivors grouped by Sex
passengers %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
  summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare), numSurv = sum(Survived)/n())
```

**Recap:**

* You've imported your data & checked it out
* You've learnt about the pipe operator `%>%`
* You can now use `dplyr` to wrangle your data: `filter` it, `arrange` it and create new features by `mutating` old ones.
* You've learnt how to easily and intuitively plot your data using `ggplot2`.
* You've learnt how to summarise your data across many dimensions, such as "Sex".

All of this and more is covered in Chapters 1 through 3 of David Robinson's [Introduction to Tidyverse course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) on DataCamp. And there's even more tidyverse gold in Chapter 4.
